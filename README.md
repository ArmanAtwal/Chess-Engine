# Chess AI with Minimax Algorithm
This project implements a simple chess AI using the minimax algorithm. The AI evaluates moves by recursively analyzing the game tree, considering different outcomes, and selecting the move that maximizes its chances of winning.

# Features
Minimax Algorithm: The AI employs the minimax algorithm to search through the game tree and determine the best move based on the evaluation of each potential outcome.
Piece Movements: The logic for each chess piece's movements has been programmed, taking into account factors such as piece blocking, capturing opponent's pieces, castling, en passant, and promoting pawns.
Integrity Maintenance: Robust mechanisms have been implemented to prevent illegal moves and maintain the integrity of the game. The current game board state is systematically checked to ensure that no moves violate the rules of chess

# Usage
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chess-ai.git](https://github.com/ArmanAtwal/Chess-Engine
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd chess-ai
3. Compile and run the application:
javac ChessAI.java, java ChessAI
4. Follow the prompts to play against the AI.

# Requirements
Java 8 or higher

# Future Enhancements
Alpha-Beta Pruning: Implement alpha-beta pruning to optimize the minimax algorithm and reduce the search space.
Improved Evaluation Function: Enhance the evaluation function to provide more accurate assessments of board positions.
User Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive chess-playing experience.
